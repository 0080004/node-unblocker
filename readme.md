# unblocker

Unblocker was originally a web proxy for evading internet censorship, similar to CGIproxy / PHProxy / Glype but 
written in node.js. It's since morphed into a general-purpose library for proxying and rewriting remote webpages.
 
All data is processed and relayed to the client on the fly without unnecessary buffering, making unblocker one of the 
fastest web proxies available.

### The magic part

The script uses "pretty" urls which, besides looking pretty, allow links with relative paths 
to just work without modification. (E.g. `<a href="path/to/file2.html"></a>`) 

In addition to this, links that are relative to the root (E.g. `<a href="/path/to/file2.html"></a>`) 
can be handled without modification by checking the referrer and 307 redirecting them to the proper 
location in the referring site. (Although the proxy does attempt to rewrite these links to avoid the redirect.)

Cookies are proxied by adjusting their path to include the proxy's URL, and a bit of extra work is done to ensure they 
remain intact when switching protocols or subdomains.

## Running the website on your computer

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 0.12.
Then [download node-unblocker](https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker/archive/master.zip), 
`cd` into the `examples/nodeunblocker.com/` directory, 
and run `npm install` to set things up. 
Then run `npm start` to start the server. It should spawn a new instance for each CPU 
core you have. 

(Note: running `node app.js` *will not work*. The server code is in the [Gatling](https://npmjs.org/package/gatling) 
package, which the `npm start` command calls automatically.)

## Running the website on heroku/bluemix/modulous/etc

This project should be runnable on a free [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) instance without 
modification - just copy the `examples/nodeunblocker.com/` folder to a new git repo and push it.

## Using unblocker as a library in your software

See `examples/nodeunblocker.com/app.js` for an example of adding a bit of middleware, see `lib/unblocker.js` for all configuration options.

## Todo

* Consider adding compress middleware to compress text-like responses
* Fully document API
* Even more tests
